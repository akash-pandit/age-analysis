# Tasks / next-steps of interest for this analysis

aging project
- create reference object w/ poscablo + pne HSCs
- DEGs for poscablo MkP/HSC populations
	- no patterning in GFP, maybe some other genes do show patterning?
	
- age-dependent integrations
	- trajectory inference (PAGA, DPT)
	- scVELO (EM model, not steady state)
	- implement pySCENIC pipeline

gene-signature construction
- Tree-ensemble-based classifier
- oHSC vs old ncMkP vs old cMkP
	- or split up into binary cats
